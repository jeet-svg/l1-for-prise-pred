# Single Linear Regression for Electricity Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a **single-variable linear regression** model in Python to predict electricity prices based on one input feature (such as demand, time, or consumption).  

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Single linear regression implementation (from scratch and/or using libraries)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization of predictions vs actual values  

## Tech Stack
- torch
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
